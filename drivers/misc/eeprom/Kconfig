config EEPROM_LEGACY
	tristate "Old I2C EEPROM reader"
	depends on I2C && SYSFS
	help
	  If you say yes here you get read-only access to the EEPROM data
	  available on modern memory DIMMs and Sony Vaio laptops via I2C. Such
	  EEPROMs could theoretically be available on other devices as well.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called eeprom.

config EEPROM_MAX6875
	tristate "Maxim MAX6874/5 power supply supervisor"
	depends on I2C
	help
	  If you say yes here you get read-only support for the user EEPROM of
	  the Maxim MAX6874/5 EEPROM-programmable, quad power-supply
	  sequencer/supervisor.

	  All other features of this chip should be accessed via i2c-dev.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called max6875.


config EEPROM_93CX6
	tristate "EEPROM 93CX6 support"
	help
	  This is a driver for the EEPROM chipsets 93c46 and 93c66.
	  The driver supports both read as well as write commands.

	  If unsure, say N.

config EEPROM_93XX46
	tristate "Microwire EEPROM 93XX46 support"
	depends on SPI && SYSFS
	help
	  Driver for the microwire EEPROM chipsets 93xx46x. The driver
	  supports both read and write commands and also the command to
	  erase the whole EEPROM.

	  This driver can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called eeprom_93xx46.

	  If unsure, say N.

config EEPROM_DIGSY_MTC_CFG
	bool "DigsyMTC display configuration EEPROMs device"
	depends on GPIO_MPC5200 && SPI_GPIO
	help
	  This option enables access to display configuration EEPROMs
	  on digsy_mtc board. You have to additionally select Microwire
	  EEPROM 93XX46 driver. sysfs entries will be created for that
	  EEPROM allowing to read/write the configuration data or to
	  erase the whole EEPROM.

	  If unsure, say N.
