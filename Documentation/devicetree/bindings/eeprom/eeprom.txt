= EEPROM Data Device Tree Bindings =

This binding is intended to represent the location of hardware
configuration data stored in EEPROMs.

On a significant proportion of boards, the manufacturer has stored
some data on an EEPROM-like device, for the OS to be able to retrieve
these informations and act upon it. Obviously, the OS has to know
about where to retrieve these data from, and where they are stored on
the storage device.

This document is here to document this.

= Data providers =

Required properties:
#eeprom-cells:	Number of cells in an eeprom specifier; The common
		case is 2.

For example:

	at24: eeprom@42 {
		#eeprom-cells = <2>;
	};

= Data consumers =

Required properties:

eeproms: List of phandle and data cell specifier triplet, one triplet
	 for each data cell the device might be interested in. The
	 triplet consists of the phandle to the eeprom provider, then
	 the offset in byte within that storage device, and the length
	 in byte of the data we care about.

Optional properties:

eeprom-names: List of data cell name strings sorted in the same order
 	      as the resets property. Consumers drivers will use
 	      eeprom-names to differentiate between multiple cells,
 	      and hence being able to know what these cells are for.

For example:

	device {
		eeproms = <&at24 14 42>;
		eeprom-names = "soc-rev-id";
	};
